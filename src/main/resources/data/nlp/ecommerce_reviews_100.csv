5.00,"Excellent quality product, I just can't wait for a less expensive generic that performs the same. So far, I haven't found one to compare and this is a little pricey."
5.00,"I absolutely LOVE this stuff. I use it mostly for my sheets, towels and comforters. You can use as much or as little as you want and it just smells wonderful. You walk in your bedroom and it just smells clean! What a great invention! I always buy when I see it on sale! Try it! I think you will love it!"
5.00,"I was used to adding fabrick softeners when the beep went off for a final rinse. Sometime that really got in the way or simply forgot to. Not any more. These downy unstopables are simply adorable and convenient. My work out clothes now really smell fresh as are the towels and bed sheets."
5.00,"I put these inside a new vacuum bag and it made the whole house smell wonderful! I was out of vac. tablets and thought I\"d try this -it works great! it was only about a quarter size of the cap-viola!"
5.00,"I use this for my sheets and towels!! The scent is fresh and lasts for days. My husband likes it too!"
5.00,"Downy smells are awesome. I love this one too. Fun new product to try, I throw it in with my towels, it helps give them the extra boost of sweet smelling clean, that they need."
3.00,"Well, I gave it three stars because it does what it says it does, but I didn't like it at all. To be honest I don't even like perfumes, so I was afraid this stuff would be too strong smelling for me. I love my Downy Fabric Softener and the soft scent it gives my cloths; but this stuff is way too strong for me, even with a little. I saw someone else mention that it makes the towels feel to rough and I totally agree. I really like my towels soft. I usually only use a tad of softener and it's enough to make my towels soft and smell nice without taking away the ability to absorb. But I used twice as much softener because of what I read and I still didn't like the feel of my towels either. I didn't notice it as much on my cloths.                                              If you like the extra scent, this will give you what you're looking for. But it's not for those, like myself, that don't like strong, perfumey smells."
5.00,"My boyfriend is a Hockey Goalie and of course sweats and reaks after his games. This stuff was absolutely amazing with the scent and also stayed smelling good for a while."
4.00,"I bought the Gain version but decided to try these, there is no difference between the two, they both make your clothes smell good. There needs to be a bigger container for these because I use them a lot. They work well for clothes that you work out in."
5.00,"I use this in the wash along with Downey Infusions Honey Flower fabric softner - our laundry smells so good for so long, wish they'd make this scent as a dryer sheet."
5.00,"These unstopables get rid of all the smells on laundry. It works like magic. I wish they were less expensive but they work amazing."
5.00,"The scent last for a long time. This is my favorite of all the unstoppables. Definately purchase again and again."
5.00,"My wife and I both have sensitive skin, so we're forced to use unscented, hypoallergenic detergents for our laundry. Unfortunately, we're both very active, and the freshness of our clothing suffers for it. This product is the perfect answer to our needs. It doesn't take a lot to freshen up a load of laundry, and we haven't had any skin irritation as a result of using it. I highly recommend it!"
4.00,"So easy to use and leaves laundry smelling fresh. Not like some fresheners that smell like cheap perfume. This scent is fabulous! Only negative is product is a bit pricey."
5.00,"I have these on subscribe and save, very good for things like blankets that are not washed very frequently, freshness lasts"
5.00,"I have been looking for something to get the smell out of my Grandsons work clothes .                                              He is a chef. I have tried baking soda, vinigar, and Oxy clean,just to name a few, with out much success.                                                But the Downy Wash scent booster, really worked.                                                                     I use my regular tide with bleach, or Gain -love the Gain), and throw a few pellets in with the beginning wash.                                              Its easy, and I do not measure anything.                                              I still use my dryer sheets,which gives a scent, but I use them so I do not have to iron!                                                                     Even using dryer sheets with the other cleaners, just never got that resturant cooking smell out of his clothes.                                                                     These are little round thin pellets.                                              This seemed expensive but you do not have to use many pellets. Maybe 15 or so.                                                                     I also use this on my clothes and my Husbands with out a problem.                                              The scent stays in the clothes, but it is NOT strong. A nice fresh clean scent.                                                                     I will be buying more.Two thumbs up."
3.00,"These smell great and are convenient because you add them at the beginning of the wash. HOWEVER the beads DO NOT DISSOLVE IN COLD WASHES. After ordering i ended up finding them at the supermarket for a much cheaper price."
4.00,"I love these Unstopables, just wish they were a little less pricey (reason for the 4 stars). Love how they make my laundry smell. I also use regular Downy, may be a little Downy freak, but the scent boosters really add a nice scent. I have tried all 3 scents & love them all. Use different ones for different pieces of laundry."
5.00,"Smells amazing! Love love love this product. Will continue to buy in the future. The smell is incredible and leaves clothes smelling great all day."
3.00,"I had seen this product advertised, and when Amazon made it available through the Vine program, I decided to give it a try. Just a word here: this product does nothing else other than to provide a scent to your laundry. It does not provide extra cleaning power or softening. So, if you - like me - use an additional cleaner to your laundry detergent, you will need to continue to use that product and this. Likewise, if you use a softening product in the wash, you will need to continue to use that as well as using this product. Considering that a person might have to use a laundry detergent, an extra cleaner (such as Oxi-clean, Clorax 2, or bleach), in wash softening rinse, AND this? It just seems like a LOT of products to be putting into the washing machine. It just seems to me it would be more logical if this product combined with some of the others: scent booster along with softening or extra cleaner/whitener/brightener. I could feel as though I'm being economical in some way - and not having to carry additional bottles to the laundry room each week!                                                                     There is no set amount one must use. I suppose this can be good or bad, it's up to the individual. One of the first loads of laundry I tried with this product, I put in a full capful, and the laundry's scent WAS boosted. Oh my, yes! The entire closet was scented from just the few items I had washed! So, caution on using a lot of this product, especially if one is very sensitive to smells. Oh, and the scent does last for a while. Quite a while.                                                                     And speaking of scent, I found a mixed bag result when I lessened the amount of this product and used it with my laundry detergent (which has its own scent) and my in-wash detergent booster (which is also slightly scented), and the Bounce sheets that I use - which are also scented. It seems that none of the scents really came through clearly. Which is probably a good thing! And that is another confusing aspect of this product. Unless one uses all laundry products that have no perfumes, normally all laundrey products have some sort of scent. And those scents don't seem to \"gel\" with this as well - unless you use A LOT of this product, and it becomes overwhelming.                                                                     I had never looked at the price of this product until I received this as an Amazon Vine product to sample. I personally find the price prohibitive, especially as this product only provides a scent and does nothing towards cleaning or softening. I have found coupons for this product, but for only $1 off, which is still way more than this budget shopper can afford. If this product did more than simply scent the laundry, I might be able to make a justification for the added expense, but for now? No, I cannot. Not in these times.                                                                     Even if this product were cheaper, and I were more inclined to purchase it in the future, I would probably use it exclusively for my towels and sheets. Personally, I found the scent too overwhelming for me, with concerns about it clashing with my perfumes (yes, it can be that strong). As to my husband? He really didn't have anything to say, but it's not really a scent a man would enjoy emanating from the shirts he wears when he hangs with his buds.                                                                     I would consider this a slightly luxary item, and if you can afford it and don't mind an extra bottle in your laundry room and like the scent, go for it! I didn't hate the product, and it certainly lived up to what it was supposed to do. I just found it expensive, cumbersome, a bit overwhelming, and sort of something along the lines of a 5th wheel."
5.00,"You sprinkle it in your wash before washing and your clothes smell so good.  I love the smell of fresh clean laundry and this product does the trick everytime!"
5.00,"Our clothes come out smelling wonderful! I use it at every wash to keep towels, bedding & clothes smelling great!"
5.00,"Love it  Love it  Love it!!!  The smell is phenominal!  The smell is definately stronget in the bottle than when the clothes come out of the washer.  I love how my clothes and sheets hold the smell for several days.  I love to walk into my bedroom and it smells so clean and fresh!  I would recommend this product to ALL and I am even having to come here to buy it because I can't find it in the stores anymore  :/"
4.00,"I came to Amazon so I can order Downy Unstopables thinking they would be cheaper (and I go through 2 bottles a week) and see that it costs at least $4 more here than in the store...great stuff but too expensive on Amazon!"
2.00,"I was excited about the Lush scent after purchasing a bottle of the Fresh scent at the store. I can not smell this one like I can the Fresh and I am dissapointed as I was hoping for a lovely lavender-type scent. I tried using more, no luck. I can't really tell if it softens my clothes much but I know it isn't scenting them and that's too bad. If you want a lasting scent, get the Fresh."
5.00,"Considering the new HE washers use less soap, I thought it would be nice to give my laundry a scent boost. Just add a small capful in the machine before the beginning of the wash cycle and it really makes a difference. Will purchase again!"
5.00,"I love this stuff!  I've used Downy for more than twenty years.  From time to time I will use a different brand--one on sale-- but I always come back to Downy.  Now with there Unstoppables line I'm even more addicted.  I was a bit worried that the little pellets might leave spots or oily stains on my clothes but I've used it now for about seven loads and haven't seen one spot!  It's a bit pricey, (you can get it cheaper at your local grocer than here) but I'm hoping to come across coupons for future purchases.  A tip for everyone--a little goes a long way.  The first time I used almost half a cap full and it was way more than I think you need to leave a fresh scent on your laundry."
5.00,"Smells wonderful!! my clothes smell soo good!"
5.00,"I love the downy unstopables. It just takes very little to get and keep your clothes smelling so so good. The scent will last a long time on your clothes after washing. I have even spinkled a small amount of these in my vacuume cleaner. I just wish the price wasn't so darn high. Even though with the price being high, there still worth buying."
5.00,"Makes my clothing smell incredible for days! Even got my parents hooked on using it instead of the regular downy."
5.00,"I LOVE this product so much. it make my laundry smell so good. Quick tip i learned from pinterest, use it in a oil warmer to make your house smell clean and fresh works great!"
5.00,"I love the product and got an excellent price. I love it, I didn't have to go out to get my favorite products when I can get them from Amazon."
5.00,"These are great to use when washing bed spreads, etc. The light scent stays with the fabric for weeks - I love it!"
5.00,"I usually use a Tide brand detergent, which worked really well with Unstopables. That said I haven't been able to find them around where I live, which happens to also be a major city so that's a little off putting when it comes to a long term buy for me. I have been concerned with what people are saying when they are going through over a pound a week though, the Downy Unstopables are quite strong, and I have just sprinkled maybe 1-2oz in with my laundry, and with my regular detergent it's great. Saying that the consumer should use \"a little or a lot\" is way too open to interpretation and you can waste a lot of your product if you don't know how much will actually still increase the smell. Downy needs to decide at what level they want, because if people are using it so quickly and it's sort of expensive, then people won't actually continue to buy it. I love the scent though, it's great and the fact I can just dump it in my HE washer and not worry is nice. Hope to fine it locally though!"
5.00,"We live in the city and have to use laundromats to clean our clothes. The dryers at these places often use super high heat and even with a dryer sheet my clothes can have a slightly burned smell. We started to use these in the wash and I have never gotten the burned smell again, our clothes come out smelling like fresh laundry again! Highly recommend especially for anyone using a laundromat."
5.00,"It leaves my clothing with a really nice scent. Depending on it will last I will buy it again, cause it's not cheap."
2.00,"I was very excited to use this product, despite reading many reviews that it doesn't leave scent in the clothing when using an HE washer. Should have listened! I was expecting my laundry to come out with a fabulous aroma that would last and last...After going through the washer, there was minimal scent, but after drying there was no scent left. I used a scant amount and moved up to a heaping cap full, with no change. It also seems to dull the effects of my fabric softener, my clothing was coming out of the dryer with a lot of static!"
4.00,"I wash two loads per week, and this product has my gym clothes smelling great...right before I destroy them again. haha What keeps me from giving 5 stars is that the product is a bit expensive to use consistently. I have varied the amounts used, and find that my loads need at least 2/3 of the cap. This can wear the bottle out quickly. I only buy when on sale."
2.00,"I tried a free sample of Downy Unstoppables Blue scent, and it worked remarkably! I absolutely loved it! But when my grocery store didn't start carrying it, I turned online to order some. The blue kind was out of stock, so I bought this kind (purple) instead, thinking it would work just as well. It doesn't! It doesn't seem to matter how much I put in, the scent doesn't last past the dryer. Very disappointing, considering how much it costs and doesn't last more than maybe 10 loads anyway. Don't waste your money on the purple kind, wait until the blue stuff is in stock!"
5.00,"Honestly...My wife made this purchase and I (like most men) thought...\"great, another smelly product...waste of money\"...However, this stuff works great...leaves a really fresh smell that actually lasts...Haha...Imagine that...A product that actually does what it says it does...Go figure...If you're on the fence, buy this...you won't be disappointed. Oh...and I do my own laundry...and not sure how much my wife uses...but I throw almost an entire cap-full in the load...And yes, these are front-loading HE friendly..."
5.00,"My boyfriend and I have been using these for about 3 months and they are amazing. Price is a little high, but we've gotten lucky and P&G has had a coupon in the brandsaver every month. First of all, Tide detergent is all we use, as it works best on his work uniforms and before we started using these, the detergent and fabric softener couldn't take the grill smell (he works in a restaurant) out of his aprons and his clothes smelled like grease the very next day. We don't even need to put much in the washer either. I just fill the blue cap until it's to the bottom mark. Makes a great air freshener too! Just dissolve some in very hot water and pour in a trigger sprayer."
5.00,"This make the clothes smelll amazing..and it really does stay..Did a whole load of towels 4 days ago and you cab still smell the fragance in the towels.. A definte recommend!"
5.00,"everything worked...We have already brought the product from a trip to America to Germany and wanted to have it again. The beads make the clothes a long lasting fresh scent. Shipping and communication with the sender worked fine. Thanks"
5.00,"I was able to try this product through Vocalpoint several weeks ago.                                                                     I love the Fresh Scent.  I love alot of fragrance when doing laundry, and this product definitely makes this chore alot more pleasurable.                                                                     Iam able to use this product instead of using fabric softener even tho it's labeled as a scent booster.  I can always count on Downy to make a great product, and this one  definitely falls into that category.                                                                     I want to try the other scent too.  I just wish it came in a larger size than 13.2 ounces, because I would definitely buy it.                                                                     I really appreciate Vocalpoint allowing me to test this product."
4.00,"Downy Unstopables commercials have been popping up all over. So much so that I've been curious as to whether the fragrance truly is unstoppable. If you've not seen the advertisements, this product is simply a scent booster for your laundry. You can throw in a little or a lot, depending on your preference. At the current price of $11.01, my choice was to use a little. True, Amazon currently has a $2 off coupon and the Lush scent is a buck cheaper, but that's still a steep price to make laundry smell better.                                                                     The fresh scent aroma, which smells absolutely wonderful, can be detected prior to opening up the bottle. Made me want to wash clothes right away. Depending on how much used, one bottle can boost the smell of about ten to twelve loads of clothes. Though the smell diminishes over time, my clothes retained the fragrance after three weeks of being in the closet. The smell would have lasted longer if I'd left them in there.                                                                     My only complaint is the price, but the product can be versatile. Put some in a knee high or tie it up in a fine netting material and you can have an aromatic sachet. It's a good way to make your entire closet smell fresh."
3.00,"It isn't that bad a little bit goes a long way. The unfortunate thing is that im kind of tired of the scent and i still have over half a bottle of it left."
1.00,"Sorry, but this stuff has such a bad smell that I had to wash my cloths again - minus the Unstopables."
5.00,"What can I say I love these things. Kinda addicted to them. My husband even demands that I keep using them. You can walk in the bedrooms and the smell is just awesome. The 2 guestrooms smell great for months and that keeps me from washing linens ever week on beds not used. Your clothes will love you and you will love your clothes. Just one hint don't use detergents or softener with scent and they work better."
2.00,"I have used up a whole bottle of Downy Unstopables. At first I thought it was ok, since it added some extra scent. But honestly, you get that from your laundry detergent and/or fabric softener, so realistically there is no reason to add yet another product and more money to the laundry.The biggest problem I have with it is that it seems like it kills the fabric softener. I have noticed my towels are stiffer and rough. It is worse than not using any fabric softener at all. Even when I don't use softener, my towels are never this rough feeling.I don't use alot of crystals at all either. I use enough to cover the bottom of the lid/cap that you use for dispensing. That is really all you need in order to add a decent amount of scent. So, the roughness is not due to using too much of the Unstopables.My other big complaint is that I can tell a huge difference in the dark loads - they attract more lint and hair. All loads have more static cling as well when using the Unstopables, but the dark loads are terrible.This product just isn't worth it for me in the long run. It adds extra unnecessary cost to the laundry. I do at least 2 loads a day, every day. Most days I have more loads. With 3 teens in sports and cheeleading, laundry is a major part of my day. I do not need it to cost more money. I get a nice amount of scent from the fabric softener and detergent, so I will stick with those and occasional stain pre treaters of course."
5.00,"great smell! I would buy this one again! If I can find it in my local store. I'm anxious to try the other scents."
2.00,"I loved the scent of this, it was on sale & I had a coupon. I'd read reviews about the scent being very strong so used in sparingly in the first load. Nothing. Tried it again and filled the entire cap, as I was doing a big load. Some items had a light pleasant fragrance, others none at all. It seemed that only the all cotton items carried the scent. However it would be far to expensive, in my opinion, to justify using it regularly. And after a few hours, the scent is definitely fading. Oh well! It was fun to try it."
5.00,"tried this on a lark; but now subscribe regularly. It works and so easy I can do the laundry though she really wants me to stay in the kitchen."
4.00,"smells good. although it is my second choice. like to use on curtains and blankets. does last for few days"
5.00,"I work out just about everyday, so needless to say, my workout gear and towels can get a little mildewy and it's so hard to get them smelling fresh. That's why I was excited to discover Downy Unstopables In Wash Fresh Scent Booster.                                                                     First off, this product is so easy to use. Just open, pour as much or as little as you'd like into the cap and toss into your washing machine. If you pour in more, you'll get a stronger scent and if you pour in less, the scent won't be as strong. Frankly, I like that you can control the scent because each load of laundry is different. I love adding extra to towels, bed sheets, and active gear, but only a little to every day clothes. Like other reviewers, I was a bit worried, since what you pour into your washing machine are little tablets or capsules and I was worried that they would not all dissolve. But have no fear. Everything dissolved and I was left with fresh-smelling laundry.                                                                     I've used scented laundry detergent and fabric softener in the past, but the smell never lasts. However, with Downy Unstopables, you'll find your laundry smelling fresh for a really long time. I look forward to trying different scents and definitely recommend."
5.00,"I have 8 sets of sheets for my bed, two sets in each of four colors. I switch colors on the first Saturday of March, June, September, and December. I pulled out the the space bag containing my yellow spring sheets last night, in preparation for putting them on the bed next weekend. When I sealed them up last June I put a couple of dryer sheets in with them in hopes of avoiding that musty smell you get in sheets that have been stored for a long time. That didn't work - yuck! I decided to wash them this weekend with half a cup of baking soda in the wash load, and a cup of white vinegar in the rinse load. That always helps, but never takes the smell away completely. The sheets are made from Tencel (third generation Rayon) so fabric softener isn't necessary, and will actually break down the fibers and shorten the life of the sheets. I was at the grocery store this morning and saw the Downy Unstopables, and thought - I'll give them a try. I bought the Fresh scent because they were available in a smaller size. I have a high efficiency portable top loading machine with no agitator. I had seen a few other people mention that the beads didn't dissolve completely, so I put in half a cap-ful, along with half a cup of baking soda, set the machine to the lowest water level, and then let it start its cycle so that the beads got spun around in the water for a few minutes. This really seemed to help with dissolving the beads. I then paused the machine, reset the water level to the right level for the load, added detergent (Mrs Meyers) and the sheets. I wash the sheets in wash bags so they don't get tangled due to the agitator-less design of my machine. I went back and added a cup of white vinegar to the rinse. The result? No musty smell whatsoever. The sheets smell like the scent of the Unstopables, with no musty smell hiding underneath. They are currently hanging on my indoor clotheslines, and making my apartment smell nice. I can't see using them on my clothes, as they are a bit expensive to use all the time, but for sheets that have been languishing in a closet (or a Space Bag) these will now become a part of my regular routine! My only gripe - why did they misspell unstoppable? Where's the extra P Downy?"
5.00,"This stuff smells great and works very well. I can honestly say that we have linen in the closet that was washed several months ago and it still smells amazing great."
4.00,"Love this scent. I don't really smell it in my clothes after they are hanging in the closet for a few days. Maybe I am not using enough in the washer. But still a very nice scent when they come out of the dryer. Love using this with my whites as it helps mask the smell of bleach that lingers in the clothes."
4.00,"After the purchase of a case of fragrance free fabric softener, this product swooped in and saved the day. The smell is delightful, fresh smell that is not overbearing and lasts three weeks (and still going....). The downfall of the product, like any scented product, is skin irritation from overdoing it. The Unstopables does not have a measuring device other than the lid (no measurement lines on lid) and the directions are \"as little or as much as you'd like\". In order to get the best scent you have to play around with how much your skin can tolerate vs scent strength. Not a deal breaker issue though. One bottle lasted over a month with a household of six"
2.00,"First of all, let me say I was so excited to try this! Who doesn't like good smelling laundry? I love the smell of the \"Fresh Scent\" unstopables.I thought the best way to try this out would be using it on blankets, towels and sheets. In the directions it states \"use as little or as much as you want\" so I decided to try it both ways. I started off using a little amount and thought maybe this was why the smell didn't last very long. Then I used a lot, I was so disappointed, the smell only lasted a couple of days also! My Downy fabric softener lasts longer than this!!! I won't be buying this product again, I will be sticking to my Tide laundry detergent and Downy fabric softener."
5.00,"Had to try these after they somehow were suggested on Amazon. They last quite some time. I use a 'couple shakes' per load, but you can use less or more depending on your needs. They are a little pricey but make your clothes smell lovely. I usually use no dyes or scents since I am sensitive and have found no trouble using the unstoppables. I bought the blue one, not sure what scent it is, but will be buying them again as I am out (after a few monthes). Oh, and it makes sweaty boy clothes smell nice too."
5.00,"I received this as a free sample and loved it so much, I immediately ordered more from Amazon.  Both scents are fantastic and stayed with the fabric until washed.  I love this for stinky teenage clothes, and getting rid of that musty smell that the washer can get in the summer when the kids leave their wet clothes too long.  It's also really nice to make towels, bedding, and bed clothes smell fresh, no matter how long they sit in the drawer or closet before using.  It may be too pretty for some men, but neither of the men in this house have complained.  My only complaint is that I later found that it sells for much less at Target and Walmart.  I wish Amazon would offer a better price as I'd love to use this with every laundry load."
5.00,"Everyone should try this because it makes your clothes smell so awesome. I ahve since found it in the stores as well"
5.00,"I think Downy hit a home run with the unstopable line. Washing towels and sheets with these and then pulling them out weeks later, the smell is still there. This is great, because using fabric softener reduces the absorbant efficacy of towel fibers. Unstopables are scent based only, no softening agent. Glow scent is not overpowering. None of the scents are."
5.00,"I love downy unstoppables but is a little expensive, I use a bottle weekly."
5.00,"These are terrific ,just the easiest to use.My clothes hold the scent for a long time. love them. will continue to buy these"
5.00,"This product is GREAT, makes my whole closet smell soooooo good, I never want to be without it. Friends and strangers are commenting on the fabulous smell and I recommend it happily."
5.00,"This thing is awesome but it works ONLY if you use the right amount, and there seems to be a widespread misconception about what the right amount is. I take exactly half of what the measuring cup can hold and it works AMAZING! I even used this once while the washing machine was filling up with the washing machine lid open, and there happened to be a fan blowing air next to the washing machine (this happened last summer) and in the time it took for the washing machine fill up, the fan blew scented air that left my apartment smelling awesome the whole day. Also, here's one trick I learned online. Take 2 table spoons of this thing and put them inside your vacuum cleaner bag at the time you're installing a new one. When you vacuum, your whole home will smell like this. Saved me from buying the expensive feebreeze branded bags they sell for my vacuum cleaner that don't even work this well. And with the clothes you're washing? Its originally intended purpose? Best product of its kind I have ever used. It's really unstoppable!"
5.00,"I makes my laundry smell good. Easy to use. Good for the wash and do not need dryer sheets with scents."
2.00,"Other than \"unstopables\" not being an actual word, this product has another problem:  who on earth is going to pay a premium - a large premium - for extra perfume for their clothes?  I won't be.                                                                     Basically, this product is a bunch of waxy-feeling granules that you add to your washing machine.  Water breaks it down, releasing its perfume, and there you have it - scented clothes.  It does the job, and the perfume is pleasant-enough smelling.                                                                     But then again, both my detergent and fabric softener also smell fine.  If I use these in combination, I end up with three different perfumes vying for supremacy, leading to a weird concoction of aromas that...shouldn't be.  Remove one (or two) of those perfumes, and the clothes are back to smelling how you figured they were.                                                                     Perhaps if you use unscented detergent and fabric softener (does that even exist?), and use this just because you fell in love with the scent, it would make sense.  In the real world, however, this product doesn't make any sense at all.  And while I received my container of it free of charge, I hope that the list price is actually a 3 or 4 pack, because not only is this nothing special (and an awkward product), but it's also quite expensive.  I won't be buying it or using it again, once this container is used up."
3.00,"i put this in two vacuums we use at home as read about on a blog to eliminate the musty/vacuum aromas. works great for emitting a nice fresh aroma; unfortunately I sneezed a lot. will be looking for someone who can use this product either as intended (if it made be sneeze i will not use it in the laundry)or in vacuum cleaner!"
5.00,"Love this product - it's the only softener that I will buy.  Liquid softeners are bad for my septic system and dryer sheets clog dryer vents.  I've noticed that the smell is very subtle (sometimes hard to detect) until you rub the fabric.  That's when the scent comes out very nicely.  My favorite is the fresh scent (blue) product."
4.00,"This is the best solution if you have stinky water. We use a filter and softener, but our well water is gross. When I have to hang dry clothes, they get this horrible egg water odor. Using this is the only solution that works. It's a miracle. And it's so much cheaper to buy them on Amazon rather than the store."
5.00,"Honestly, I thought these were a big waste of money when my husband brought them home...I mean, we already use Downey...so, I thought we did not need. Ha, ha, ha...now I'm the one adding them to the cart. They smell great and leave a nice scent a bit longer than softener."
1.00,"This toxic product scored an F on EWG.ORG stating HIGHEST CONCERN. Potentially significant hazards to health or the environment. Please do your research before exposing yourself and your family to this product."
5.00,"You should not have to filled this stupid box out. Thanks in advance for removing this stupid and senseless requirements!"
5.00,"I have a very musty house with pretty bad airflow. this helps to keep my clothes fresher smelling for a longer amount of time."
5.00,"love, love, love this stuff. it makes laundry smell really fresh. i love curling up in my comforter or using towels right out of the shower after doing laundry. one capful into the washing machine works for a full load. you can put the beads in at the beginning of the load (no more waiting for the washer to tell you its time for softener, or goocking up your washing machine in teh softener slot), and when water goes into the machine, the beads dissolve easily - I have never had any residue from these beads. I still use the dryer sheets occasionally but you dont need to with these. the scent is great - not overpowering, it is the light and fresh."
3.00,"I saw this and decided to try it out since my clothes never seem to have that fresh scent from ether the laundry detergent OR fabric softeners. I was a bit skeptical at first, but I do have to admit, this works. I actually had a couple co-workers comment on the \"fabric softener\" I was using.                                                                     That being said, WHY can't there be a laundry detergent or softener that delivers this? Why should we have to pay for yet another item to deliver that fresh laundered scent? And why must it be so darned expensive? I find to get my clothes to the scent I want, I have to use about half a capful of the Unstoppables, and if I want all my clothes to have this fresh scent, this doesn't last very long.                                                                     Bottom line; yes it works and well, and if you have the money to spend on it it's perfect but I can't justify the price for the performance. If I use this I will use it for certain items of clothing. In the mean time, the search continues for a laundry detergent or softener that delivers what it promises instead of having to shell out the $ for a separate product."
3.00,"this is ok but pretty pricey I love the smell but it is hard at times to use sometimes if you are in a hurry and you use to much and wow does the smell lingers it is not bad but to much is to much would buy it but just to expensive"
5.00,"Wow super fresh smell. I love this item!"
5.00,"Makes my laundry smell great! Even after two weeks in the drawer, they come out as fresh as when they went in."
5.00,"I take care of my mom who had a stroke and is incotinent, with these I don't have that bleach and pee smell that I was getting. Now I can use a little bit of bleach to disinfect and the clothes come out smelling wonderful."
5.00,"This washing scent booster is great. I find it leaves all my clothes smelling so much better. I use it for every load. Other companies have such a product, but are much more expensive. The scent is there and it's great. Highly recommend this over the other brands which are so much more expensive."
2.00,"I've been using this for weeks now, switching from the purple to the blue. It smells wonderful in the wash, but I don't find the scent to be lasting much after the dryer except on towels. I would expect my entire closet should be wafting with the wonderful scent by now, having washed nearly all my clothing in it, but alas. . . no. I had hoped my bed linens would retain the scent after making the bed, but by the time I climb into bed. . . not so much and certainly nothing after a day or so. Over priced and over-rated in my opinion and just a gimmicky thing. Perhaps if my washer and dryer were on the main floor, I would have the added benefit of fragrancing my home as I did the wash, but unfortunately, they're in the basement. Very disappointed. Will have to try the Gain product."
5.00,"I love to add these to my laundry to add a subtle scent to my clothes and towels. If I add more than just the bottom of the cap, it's too strong and makes me sneeze."
3.00,"works fine used for bedding, smells great but for clothing,scent did not linger at all,ill stick to my downey liguid.thanks I lov walmart!!!!!!!!!!!"
4.00,"I bought these solely to enhance the smell of my awful dog beds when I was them- I feel no amount of a fabric softener (liquid or sheets) compares to these bad boys. Also does wonders to my normal laundry."
5.00,"I absolutely love these Downy Unstopables. It keeps my clothes so fresh smelling for weeks. I will always use and enjoy this product."
5.00,"I have hard water that sometimes smells like blood. Iron. Gotta love it. This stuff makes everything smell nice and clean and lasts, too! When my friends run out, they come to me begging for a cap full. Its just that good!"
5.00,"IT WORKS GREAT.I STARTED WITH A VERY SMALL AMOUNT,I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.NO ITCH,NO RASH,CLOTHES SMELL GREAT,EVEN FROM THE FRONT LOADER...LOVE THIS STUFF !! I WILL GET MORE"
3.00,"I like the smell, very light floral scent. After a load is washed it leaves a nice light scent on the clothes, but doesn't seem to last very long. But the price for this seems a little high."
5.00,"I have tried every different brand of these scent shaky thingies and this is definitely The Best. Last the longest and smells delic!"
5.00,"I fell in love with this product. Our clothes smell so amazing all day long and the Fresh scent is so crisp."
5.00,"What can I say, I absolutely LOVE this product. Recieved a sample in the mail and it sat there for about four months. My friend told me how much she loved using the product(although quite pricey). I used my sample on the next load and my laundry room even smelled wonderful. With three boys and a husband in construction, the laundry can get pretty stinky. Using this, it literally takes all that stink and funky smell away from the clothes! Even a few guys at work said that my husbands' shirt smelled good, much to his embarassment. =) Only down side is the price. =("
5.00,"This is a Great Product, no need for softening sheets in the Dryer and the convenience of putting it in before the wash is awesome......But the Fresh Sent just last forever, I'm Really Impressed! :)"
5.00,"I am obsessed with this stuff!! It seriously makes the clothes smell SO amazing!! And for a LONG time!! I refuse to wash my clothes without it. And as much as I LOVE Gain the Downy Unstoppables work MUCH better!! And I even tested out the crystals and they PALE in comparison!!"
5.00,"the unstopables work great and have a real good smell. the scent does hold up. i put some in a spray bottle and spray it on my bedding an also in my car smells great. thanks jw"
3.00,"Downy Unstopables are ok, they do leave a nice scent in your laundry without the use of softener. For me it was just another item I have to remember to add to the wash and I keep forgetting it, plus it just does not leave enough of a scent that lasts."
4.00,"I haven't used this product with my normal laundry load, but I have used it with bathroom rugs and towels. In each load I used a full cap, and each load smelled noticeably better. However, the scent was gone within 3-4 days of sitting in the guest linens closet."
5.00,"I've been using this product for at least a year now, and I love it. I don't have to use much at all, and I still end up with wonderful smelling clothes. I used a quarter cap full in the load with my uniforms and the scent is still going strong. I can smell it when I open drawers to grab a shirt, and I can still smell it on the shirt at the end of the day. I normally get this at the commissary back home, but being on deployment, this is one of the only ways to get Unstopables. I know there were some reviews about it being cheaper at Walmart, but for some of us there is no Walmart or Publix for thousands of miles. My one and only complaint is about how long it took for Amazon to fulfill the order. I ordered it on 19Dec, and they shipped it at the beginning of January. Also, there have been reviews that you have to use non scented detergent or fabric softener for the scent of the Unstopables to shine through. I never had an issue when I used scented detergent, and I still have no issue now that I'm using home made detergent. And I use vinegar as a fabric softener now, and it doesn't affect this stuff at all."
